# OpenPTB
A truly open source version of PTB, Pidgeon Toolbag

# Why?
Pidgeon Toolbag isn't truly open source. While the source code is included with the addon, you can't contribute upstream, since its restricted to developers only (and those are selected by Pidgeon Tools). In addition, there's no Git history. 

The point of this is to make a version of Pidgeon Toolbag that is truly open source by the community.

This repo is based on the Pidgeon Toolbag repo starting from `6be8ea0e7e31d7894e21d19260767bc6e3d958b3` (December 3rd 2023)

# What are the goals of OpenPTB?
To:
- Keep OpenPTB as a community project, not just a project of a handful of developers
- Remove and avoid any "features" in PTB that serve to make non-paying users feel second class
- Be distinct from PTB and eventually a competing product

# How did you get the repo?
I (Mahid Sheikh) used to be a developer for Pidgeon Tools until the end of 2023, and I worked on Pidgeon Toolbag. Specifically, I worked with the dependencies and making sure they were installed properly. I was removed however when Kevin (the manager of Pidgeon Tools) got into a bit of drama on another server (unrelated to Pidgeon Tools). I won't expand on the details further (other than that it was a debate over whether users of free products have the right to complain about said products if they didn't pay the devs), but I will say that action was extremely unprofessional on his part, an opinion agreed upon by many of the people I talked to afterwards.

Since I still had the Pidgeon Toolbag source code, with the full Git history (at least up to December 3rd, 2023), I decided to make this repo

# Will Pidgeon Tools take this down?
Pidgeon Toolbag is licensed under GPL, as all Blender addons have to be. Thus, they don't have legal standing to take this down.

# Why is this behind the current version of Pidgeon Toolbag?
I only had the cloned Git repo up to December 3rd, 2023, around the beta release of v1.0.

# How do I see the original source code?
Check the `old-main` branch
